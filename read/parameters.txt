The read command in Bash is used to read a line of input from the user or from a file descriptor. It has several options that can modify its behavior. Here are all the parameters available for the read command:

-a array: Read the data into an array.
-d delim: Read until the first occurrence of delim, instead of newline.
-e: Use Readline to obtain the line.
-i text: Use text as the initial text for Readline.
-n nchars: Read nchars characters rather than a whole line.
-N nchars: Read exactly nchars characters, ignoring delimiters.
-p prompt: Display prompt before reading input.
-r: Do not allow backslashes to escape any characters.
-s: Silent mode (do not echo input coming from a terminal).
-t timeout: Time out and return failure if a complete line of input is not read within timeout seconds.
-u fd: Read from file descriptor fd instead of the standard input.
